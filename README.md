# MMS3 to MMS4 JSON Transformation Script
This is a simple Python3 script to transform JSON extracted from MMS3 to be imported to MMS4, focusing on elements that are ve only and never imported into cameo. 

This requires a pushed project onto MMS4 first, but before running any view generation.

## What it does
All attributes generated by MMS3 are removed. This is essentially all attributes which start with an underscore ("_") aside from "_contents" and "_appliedStereotypeIds".

## To run
```shell
./convert.py PATH/FILENAME
```
OR
```
python convert.py PATH/FILENAME
```
This will create a new file in a new directory called "processed" in the given path of the file. Post this file to the mms4 project elements

## Get file from mms3 project
```
curl -X GET -u user http://mms3.server/alfresco/service/projects/projectId/refs/master/elements > project.json
```

## post resulting file to mms4 project
```
curl -X POST -u user -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d @output.json http://mms4.server/projects/projectId/refs/master/elements 
```
